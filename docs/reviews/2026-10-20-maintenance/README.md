# ChatGPT maintenance handoff execution — 2026-10-20

This record follows the [original handoff index](https://github.com/franksong2702/dsh-codex-connect/blob/0b5dd24f89d1ba4ced989004c0b02ab6edce2365/docs/reviews/2026-10-20-chatgpt-handoff/README.md)
and the repository's `AGENTS.md` / [maintenance scope](../../maintenance-scope.md).

Current ChatGPT performed the analysis and used the connected WebCodex MCP for
repository reads, edits, native commands and tests. No Codex CLI, Coding Agent,
additional model session, or live provider request was started. WebCodex itself
was neither edited nor upgraded.

Before changes, the repository origin, main/PR refs, working tree, existing
worktrees and workflow sessions were inspected read-only. Existing work and
untracked files were preserved. All new writes used fresh isolated worktrees;
no existing workflow task was resumed.

## Outcomes

| Item | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| [PR #358](pr358/README.md) | Paired macOS and Linux checks passed. Earlier cloud writer-lock timeout is preserved and remains unexplained; merge hold retained. |
| [PR #327](pr327-installed-native/README.md) | Exact a297fa6 retains main integration and the native return-value fix. Later installed-CLI native acceptance passed on macOS and isolated Linux; all ten CI checks pass. The independent static COMMENT explicitly retains draft/unmerged status. |
| [Issue #65](issue-65.md) | Only oversized-user retention/recall and checkpoint-only retries remain active. Pure retention boundary reproduced without credentials; neither item is declared resolved. |

Main source inspected: `e5579b71339ba932dec7dfba497fc97df8fbf124`.
PR #358 source tested: `eec7c892f5dfba21009bcaa71db8f626cbbfa9df`.
PR #327 incoming source: `293959257df85eb1ad7a779a0086f590d5221dc1`.
PR #327 integrated/native-tested source: `a297fa6808982eed57c219a8a3518bd8c37b6761`.

The continuation records #358's unresolved underlying timeout separately in
[issue #376](https://github.com/franksong2702/dsh-codex-connect/issues/376).
That tracker does not waive #358's hold, and #65 still has exactly its two
maintenance items. No #358 full suite or broad #65 experiment was repeated.

These are source/test records. They do not claim a release, daily installation,
service restart, real-account migration or official Host delivery. No force
push or safety-check disablement is part of this work.
